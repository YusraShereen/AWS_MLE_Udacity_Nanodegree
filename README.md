# Projects of AWS ML Engineer Udacity Nanodegree Program

## 1. Prediction of Bike Sharing Demand
Bike-sharing demand is highly relevant to related problems companies encounter, such as Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. 
Predicting demand not only helps businesses prepare for spikes in their services but also improves customer experience by limiting delays.

In the end, we submitted several entries to the competition and achieved a rank within Kaggle.
A report of findings is also created to share publicly on Kaggle to showcase work.

## 2. Deploy and monitor a ML workflow for Scones Unlimited
The motive of the project is to build a Machine Learning Model that performs image classification through ML workflows using Amazon's Sage Maker. The Step Functions 
linked with the lambda scripts are used to automate various tasks of Machine Learning process from Data Preparation, Model Creation, Model Deployment and Inference.
